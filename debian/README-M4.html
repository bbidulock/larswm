    <h1>Hacks for the larswm window manager</h1>

    <p>The X11 window manager "<a
    href="http://larswm.fnurt.net/">larswm</a>" is a minimalist window
    manager descended from 9wm, which was itself inspired by Plan 9's
    windowing system.  The core idea is that windows should arrange
    themselves, allowing the user to concentrate on getting the job done,
    instead of pixel-dinking.</p>

    <p>I got tired of maintaining a large larswm configuration file
    containing lots of custom key definitions for my Logitech iTouch
    keyboard, so I wrote some M4 macros to simplify my configuration
    file, and to automate the numbering of application key directives.
    Those of you who administer <code>sendmail</code> will be familiar
    with the process of using a short macro file to produce a long
    (and essentially write-only) configuration file. 

    <p>To use the configuration macros you will need:</p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="larswm.m4">larswm.m4</a></dt>
      <dd>This file defines macros that
	expand to larswm configuration directives.   You should not need
	to modify this file, just place it in your home dir, or wherever
	you keep your "larswm.mc" source file.  Comments explain how
	to use the macros.</dd>
      <dt><a href="example-larswm.mc">larswm.mc</a></dt>
      <dd>This file contains the macro invocations that expand to
      larswm directives suitable for .larswmrc</dd>
      <dt class="ul">A .larswmrc generated from larswm.mc</dt>
      <dd>Whenever you modify larswm.mc, regenerate your .larswmrc by
      running <blockquote><code>m4 larswm.mc >$HOME/.larswmrc</code></blockquote></dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Bugs and gotchas</h2>
    
    <ul>

      <li>Some of macros don't work in BSD m4.  I'll fix this someday.
	Until then, install GNU m4, and run <code>gm4</code> instead
	of <code>m4</code>.

      <li>If you want larswm to utilise extended keys such as
	<code>XF86Standby</code>, make sure they are defined in your X
	keymap.  If you see "<code>Keysym 0x0, NoSymbol</code>" in the
	output of <code>xev</code> when you press your extended keys,
	you need to use <code>xmodmap</code> to set the
	<em>keycode&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;keysym</em> mapping as in <a
	href="example-xmodmap">this example</a>.  If you try to trap
	an unknown keysym, larswm will break---clients such as xterm
	will just beep plaintively at you when you press any key.

    </ul>
