***************************************
* larswm - Lars Tiling Window Manager *
***************************************


Introduction:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| This is not really a completely new window manager, but rather a
| heavily modified version of David Hogan's 9wm.
| In following his licensing terms, I release this under
| a different name than 9wm.
| Please see the file README.9wm for David's original license.
| 
| The same deal applies to Arnold Robbins' menu program (9menu)
| that is included in the larswm distribution. I changed the name
| of it because I made a couple of changes to the code, and also
| so that if you use a package manager to install both larswm
| and 9menu, you would not get a conflict.
| Please see the file README.9menu for Arnold's original license.

Where can I find new versions? Where can I find more documentation?

How do I compile and install it?

xmkmf -a
make install install.man


Compiling with gcc under Solaris:

I don't have Sun C installed, only gcc. In order to make the Imakefile
work with the standard X11 installation in /usr/openwin, I had to add
a few lines at the top of the Imakefile.
If you're having trouble compiling on Solaris, try editing/removing those.

Known problems:

When opening xterms they sometimes think they are 80x24 even though
they have been tiled to some other size.
Workaround: Put this line in your .bashrc or .cshrc

	eval `resize`


Other issues:

1. Keyboard shortcuts don't work when any of the locked modifiers are active.
   That is, if you configure a shortcut as Control-Alt-x, then it will
   not work if ShiftLock, NumLock or ScrollLock is on.
	Workaround:	If you most of the time have NumLock on, you can
			configure all your keyboard shortcuts to include
			the Mod2 modifer. That is, if you want to use
			Alt-Tab to go to previous window, instead of
			larswm.prev_window_key: Tab
			larswm.prev_window_mod: Alt
			change the last line to read
			larswm.prev_window_mod: Mod2+Alt
			Now it won't work when NumLock is off, so only
			do this if NumLock is on most of the time.
			The names for the modifers you might want to do
			this for are:
				Key		Symbol
				-------------------------
				CapsLock	ShiftLock
				NumLock		Mod2
				ScrollLock	Mod5

SUN KEYBOARD SPECIFICS:

To make the KP_ bindings work on a Sun keyboard, I use this xmodmap file:

---BEGIN---
keycode 75 = KP_Home
keycode 76 = KP_Up
keycode 77 = KP_Prior
keycode 98 = KP_Left
keycode 99 = KP_Begin
keycode 100 = KP_Right
keycode 119 = KP_End
keycode 120 = KP_Down
keycode 121 = KP_Next
---END---

Just put this in a file somewhere, and load it from
your .xsession BEFORE starting larswm:

---BEGIN---
xmodmap /path/to/file
---END---

If you are using another type of keyboard, and the keypad doesn't
seem to work, use 'xev' to find the keycodes for each key, and then
remap them in a similar way.


LICENSING:

Please see README.9wm for David Hogan's original 9wm license
and README.9menu for Arnold Robbins' original 9menu license.
The same type of license applies to all of my code.
